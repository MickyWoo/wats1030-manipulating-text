so far Im liking how forward Nano is, it was a little bit of a struggle trying to understand the shortcut keys 
at first, but once I got used to it, things started to flow and get easier. The basic commands are somewhat familiar to windows in copy, paste, moving through lines and such just on different shortcuts so its just about memorizing these commands. Other than that I don't really have that much of an issue with nano. As for vi, this text manipulator feels a little more archaic, in the sense that there are limiations to how things much be done to copy paste, edit text and moving up and down lines. Everything is basic in the sense that you dont need a moust of keypad and all the text manipulation can be done with just a keyboard. thats how I currently feel about the text manipulators
